# how to load the game
firstly download the .TIC file, and download, or enter the [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) website
depending on what you have chosen you need to do slightly diferent steps to load the cart

if on the website you need to type the command "add", then a popup will appear asking for a file choose the cart

if on desktop you need to type the command "folder", then a file explorer window will pop up, move the cartrige there
(altough good luck if you decide to mantain fantasy console game jam code, you'll need it)

[to export](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Console), altough it probably dosen't work on the web build,

to play the game just load it using
